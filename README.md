# Basic-FOSS

An unofficial FOSS, privacy-preserving client for Basic-Fit.

## App

The Basic-FOSS app is made such that it **doesn't send any requests** after logging in once and works completely offline. This is to maximize privacy and reduce unnecessary tracking, while retaining all **vital** functionality... this means that interacting with the AI virtual trainers won't be implemented by design, as that isn't part of the core functionality and only increases tracking.  
\
A new goal I've set myself is to make it compatible with smartwatches, as lack of support for smartwatches was one of the biggest complaints I've seen in reviews about the Basic-Fit app
